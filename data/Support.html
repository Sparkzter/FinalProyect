	<h2>Bipolar Disorder</h2>
		<h4> Helping Yourself </h4>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Pinpoint your stressors and triggers.</b> Are there specific times when you find yourself stressed? People, places, jobs and even holidays can play a big role in your mood stability. Symptoms of mania and depression may start slow, but addressing them early can prevent a serious episode. Feelings of mania may feel good at first, but they can spiral into dangerous behavior such as reckless driving, violence or hypersexuality. Depression may begin with feeling tired and being unable to sleep. </li>
				<li><b>Avoid drugs and alcohol.</b> These substances can disturb emotional balance and interact with medications. Both depression and mania make drugs and alcohol attractive options to help you “slow down” or “perk up,” but the potential damage can block your recovery. </li>
				<li><b>Establish a routine.</b> Committing to a routine can help you take control and help prevent depression and mania from taking control. For example, to keep the energy changes caused by depression and mania in check, commit to being in bed only eight hours a night and up and moving the rest of the time. Aerobic exercise is a good strategy for regulating body rhythm.</li>
				<li><b>Learn from past episodes.</b> Pattern recognition is essential to spotting the early symptoms of an impending manic episode. Accepting support from family members or friends who can recognize early symptoms is important. Symptoms often follow very specific patterns, and this can be learned and planned for. 2 nights of a small sleep change or the even the repeated use of a certain phrase can be examples of early warning signs.  </li>
				<li><b>Form healthy relationships.</b> Relationships can help stabilize your moods. An outgoing friend might encourage you to get involved with social activities and lift your mood. A more relaxed friend may provide you with a steady calm that can help keep feelings of mania under control.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h4> Helping a Family Member or Friend </h4>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Recognize early symptoms.</b> You may be able to prevent a serious episode of the illness before it happens. Symptoms of mania and depression often have warning signs. The beginnings of mania typically feel good and that means your family member may not want to seek help. Identify signals such as lack of sleep and speaking quickly that signal impending mania. A deep depression often only begins with a low mood, feeling fatigued or having trouble sleeping. </li>
				<li><b>Communicate.</b> Not everyone enjoys confronting problems head on, but doing so is critical to healthy communication. Make time to talk about problems. But know that not just any time is right. For example, if your family member has bipolar II and becomes angry, it might be safe to try and talk through the situation. But if your friend with bipolar I becomes angry, your reaction may need to be different. It’s more likely that this anger will turn to rage and become dangerous, including physical violence.</li>
				<li><b>React calmly and rationally.</b> Even in situations where your family member or friend may “go off,” ranting at you or others, it’s important to remain calm. Listen to them and make them feel understood, then try to work toward a positive outcome.</li>
			</ul>

				<li><b>Encourage continued treatment.</b> Family and friends can be most helpful in encouraging someone to engage in proper treatment for this complicated and frustrating illness.</li>

	<h2>Schizophrenia</h2>
		<h4> Helping Yourself </h4>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Manage Stress.</b> Stress can trigger psychosis and make the symptoms of schizophrenia worse, so keeping it under control is extremely important. Know your limits, both at home and at work or school. Don’t take on more than you can handle and take time to yourself if you’re feeling overwhelmed.</li>
				<li><b>Try to get plenty of sleep.</b> When you’re on medication, you most likely need even more sleep than the standard eight hours. Many people with schizophrenia have trouble with sleep, but lifestyle changes such as getting regular exercise and avoiding caffeine can help.</li>
				<li><b>Avoid alcohol and drugs.</b> It’s indisputable that substance abuse affects the benefits of medication and worsens symptoms. If you have a substance abuse problem, seek help.</li>
				<li><b>Maintain connections.</b> Having friends and family involved in your treatment plan can go a long way towards recovery. People living with schizophrenia often have a difficult time in social situations, so surrounding yourself with people who understand this can make the transition back into daily social life smoother. If you feel you can, consider joining a schizophrenia support group or getting involved with a local church, club, or other organization.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h4> Helping a Family Member or Friend </h4>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Respond calmly.</b> To your loved one, the hallucinations seem real, so it doesn’t help to say they are imaginary. Calmly explain that you see things differently. Being respectful without tolerating dangerous or inappropriate behavior.</li>
				<li><b>Pay attention to triggers.</b> You can help your family member or friend understand, and try to avoid, the situations that trigger his or her symptoms or cause a relapse or disrupt normal activities.</li>
				<li><b>Help ensure medications are taken as prescribed.</b> Many people question whether they still need the medication when they’re feeling better, or if they don’t like the side effects. Encourage your loved one to take his or her medication regularly to prevent symptoms from coming back or getting worse.</li>
				<li><b>Understanding lack of awareness (anosognosia).</b> Your family member or friend one may be unable to see that he or she has schizophrenia. Rather than trying to convince the person he or she has schizophrenia, you can show support by helping him or her be safe, get therapy, and take the prescribed medications.</li>
				<li><b>Help avoid drugs or alcohol.</b> These substances are known to worsen schizophrenia symptoms and trigger psychosis. If your loved one develops a substance use disorder, getting help is essential.</li>
				</ul>
